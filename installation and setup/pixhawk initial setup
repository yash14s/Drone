1. Checked SD cards's contents. Log,terrain files were present along with arducopter.bak. Ignored them and moved on.
2. Connect GPS, Buzzer, Arming switch.
3. Plug in to the laptop and open Mission Planner.
4. Go to Device manager and check the available COM port and select the same in mission planner.
5. Intial Setup -> Install Firmware. Firware = Copter Official 4.0.6; Platform = FMUv3. Leave the version blank.
6. Perform calibrations are per video[1].

  


At my home:
1. No SD card with the package. 
2. Take an SD card, and format it. Now insert it in the pixhawk.
3. When pixhawk was plugged in via USB, It was detected on COM4 (Legacy FMU). We launched MP, Initial Setup -> Install firmware. MP prompts to plug out the board and plug in so that it detects board. But when we plug it back in, MP says it can't identify the board. We suspect it is a firmware issue.
4. Close MP.
5. Install QGC -> Plug in Pixhawk - Install PX4 firmware. Close QGC. We only used QGC to install the latest stable PX4 firmware.
6. Open MP. Initial Setup -> Install firmware. Firware = Copter Official 4.0.7; This time MP identifies the pixhawk. CubeBlack? NO. Install chibiOS.
7. Perform accelerometer, magnetometer calibrations are per video[1].
8. Radio calibration: Since we are not using a PPM encoder, connect motors to the pixhawk following the convention in[2]. After connecting, continue as per video[1]. 
9. Connect, and verify functioning of HUD.
10. For arming- Press arming switch. Got a pre-arm error: RC_5 trim greater than MAX, RC_6 trim greater than MAX. Solution: Config/Tuning -> Full Param list. Alter values of RC_5 trim AND RC_6 trim
11. Waiting for 3D fix. This took 20 mins (first time).
12. Perform telemetry setup as per [6] and [4].
