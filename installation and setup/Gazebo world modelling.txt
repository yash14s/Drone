1. Get some open source gazebo models
i. $ git clone https://github.com/osrf/gazebo_models.git
ii. $ echo 'export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=~/gazebo_ws/gazebo_models:${GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH}' >> ~/.bashrc
iii. $ source ~/.bashrc

2. Follow IQ's tutorial [1], [2] to recreate their gazebo world. Note that later on we'll create worlds in our own ROS package
i. Make a new file in ~/catkin_ws/src/iq_sim/worlds/ called hills.world
ii. Copy paste the sdf code given in [2] in hills.world. This code defines the physics, the drone, and attaches a camera. Need to learn sdf coding for more customisation.
iii. Create hills.launch in ~/catkin_ws/src/iq_sim/launch as shown in [2]. Copy paste the code.
iv. $ sudo -s
	This is done so that file gets saved. 
v. # roslaunch iq_sim hills.launch
	A new empty world is launched, with the drone and camera as defined in the sdf code. Now we will proceed to add a terrain and other objects in the world via gazebo's GUI.
v. Go to the insert tab and add objects and terrain as per [1]
vi. Override hills.world
